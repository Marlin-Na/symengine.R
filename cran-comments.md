## Version 0.2.0:

This version will compile the bundled C++ library from source instead of downloading binaries on Windows. It requires Rtools40 toolchains and the following MinGw packages:

 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-cmake
 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-gmp
 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-mpfr
 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-make # (the MSYS2 make doesn't work for cmake)

On Windows, there are WARNING and NOTE about CR or CRLF line endings. However, those files were generated by cmake, which are targeted specifically to Windows. As a proof, there is no such warning on Linux or Mac OS.
