## Version 0.1.4:

This mainly updated building procedure on Windows to build the C++ library from source based on the Rtools40 toolchains. Additionally this tries to address the build error when checking LTO.

On Windows, I need the following dependencies:

 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-cmake
 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-gmp
 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-mpfr
 pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-make # (the MSYS2 make doesn't work for cmake)

On Windows, there are WARNING and NOTE about CR or CRLF line endings. However, those files were generated by cmake, which are targeted specifically to Windows. As a proof, there is no such warning on Linux or Mac OS. So I think it should be fine.

Additional, in configure(.win), AR and RANLIB variables generated from "R CMD config" were passsed to cmake. So this will hopefully resolves the build error when checking LTO.
